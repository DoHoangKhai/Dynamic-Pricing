  "description": "This Quencher H2.0 is generously sized (but not oversized) with an easy-carry, comfort-grip handle and a narrow base that will fit most cup holders. Long day of meetings? Rowing class? Trip out of town? Our durable 30 oz tumbler, made with recycled stainless steel, is up to the hydration challenge. The double-wall vacuum insulation will keep your water cold for 9 hours and iced for 40 hours. And to cap things off, there\u2019s an advanced FlowState\u2122 lid that features a rotating cover with three positions: a straw opening designed to resist splashes with a seal that holds the reusable straw in place, a drink opening, and a full-cover top.",
